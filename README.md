# Ideathon_2022
Skeleton Code that I prepared as a part of my Logistics App in Ideathon_2022.

Used 'Skeleton_Code_for_Logistics_and_Analytics.ipynb' as a part of Ideathon 2022 (Organized by VIT Bhopal's Health-O-Tech Club) to demonstrate the skeleton code that
we would use to implement our logistics app.

My team "Forged Titans" secured 7th place in the competition as a result of this.
